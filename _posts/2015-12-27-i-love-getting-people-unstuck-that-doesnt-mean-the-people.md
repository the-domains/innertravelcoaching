I LOVE GETTING PEOPLE UNSTUCK. 

That doesn't mean the people I coach are unsuccessful in work and life -- it's actually quite the opposite. Before I began my life coaching journey, in between my world travels, studying yoga philosophies, living for a time in the L.A. sunshine, and of course, rocking out at concerts -- I used to work in the marketing field. So I know you are busy...so busy. But busy isn't a substitute for purpose or connection. And busy can quickly turn into burnout. I get that you have crazy days, and that's okay. But with coaching I will calm you down, call you out -- and hold you accountable.   BECAUSE LOOKING INWARD, AND TELLING IT LIKE IT IS, IS HOW I'VE CARVED MY OWN PATH. 

And now, it's how I guide others to that same freedom. Even the busiest of us seek meaning, adventure, peace, and happiness in our daily lives, our relationships, on a road trip, in a new class, or in -- well, a yoga practice. Inner travel is just about seeking that inside yourself, too. And your inner travel coach -- is there to help you navigate.   SO YOU CAN GET UNSTUCK, GET ON YOUR PATH, AND GO FOR IT.
